Create a Spring Boot based web application for modeling following entities:

Book
-id autoincrement
-name
-author
-category
-releaseYear

Chapter
-id autoincrement
-index
-name
-numPages
-bookId (this is FK, won't become a field in class)

The relationship between Book and Chapter is 1-N, use fetch=EAGER and Cascade=Persist
For automatic creation of tables, add the following additional property in 

application.properties file:

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update


Part 1:
Create a RestFul service that allows addidion,listing,removal and updation of Books
(use api/ prefix for all restful endpoints)

DO PART 2 only after Part1

Part 2: 
Create a HTML/JSP based views to support addition,listing and removal of books
To use JSPs in your Spring boot app, add the following bean definition method to the 

main class, ie, the class annotated with @SpringBootApplication:

    @Bean
    public ViewResolver viewResolver() {
        InternalResourceViewResolver viewResolver = new 

InternalResourceViewResolver();
        viewResolver.setViewClass(JstlView.class);
        viewResolver.setPrefix("/");
        viewResolver.setSuffix(".jsp");
        return viewResolver;
    }

and add the following dependencies to the pom.xml:

    <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.embed</groupId>
            <artifactId>tomcat-embed-jasper</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
            <artifactId>jstl</artifactId>
            @Bean
    public ViewResolver viewResolver() {
        InternalResourceViewResolver viewResolver = new 

InternalResourceViewResolver();
        viewResolver.setViewClass(JstlView.class);
        viewResolver.setPrefix("/");
        viewResolver.setSuffix(".jsp");
        return viewResolver;
    }

and add the following dependencies to the pom.xml:

    <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.embed</groupId>
            <artifactId>tomcat-embed-jasper</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
            <artifactId>jstl</artifactId>
            @Bean
    public ViewResolver viewResolver() {
        InternalResourceViewResolver viewResolver = new 

InternalResourceViewResolver();
        viewResolver.setViewClass(JstlView.class);
        viewResolver.setPrefix("/");
        viewResolver.setSuffix(".jsp");
        return viewResolver;
    }

and add the following dependencies to the pom.xml:

    <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.embed</groupId>
            <artifactId>tomcat-embed-jasper</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
            <artifactId>jstl</artifactId>
        </dependency>

The JSPs should be created under the folder,src/main/resources/META-INF/resources 

(Create the folders as needed)
